# School Gr10 - C Programs Omnicode

A compilation of small programs made in grade 10 computer science, rolled into one program for convenience.

## How to Run

Download the file and / or run the code on your IDE of choice (Codeblocks or DevC++ should both work). A menu should appear with many options representing various programs.

## How to Use

The programs are simple enough that in-depth explanation is likely not required for use. The tic tac toe game, in particular, is detailed elsewhere on Github as a separate program.
